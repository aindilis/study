# this is a useful mechanism by which we can teach with study.

# once the tree of knowledge has been navigated, the user selects what
# they would like to learn and can use the emacs interface to
# constantly select new areas

# what they have read is recorded and then.

# the user determines how much time they have to study each concept,
# leaving it blank or setting global time limits allows the software
# to select how much time

# also if the user is leaving out something that out to be learned,
# like dependencies, or completenesses, system calculates adding those
# as well

# knowledge of what the user already knows must come into play which
# is why we must have knowledge extraction from text working.

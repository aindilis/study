Obviously this requires a focused crawler.

Now we work  on the important business of  identifying redundant text,
and orienting the search.

The  search I  feel  it  in my  heart  must derive  in  part from  the
questions and  statements the user  has been making.  In  other words,
there  are  existing contexts,  unresolved  questions,  open areas  to
investigate, and so forth.

The goal  of the search  interface is to  help the user to  read that.
And, in other words, to always keep the reader busy.

Textual quality metrics like LSI should be considered.

In lieu  of a really advanced  telepathic system.  The goal  is to get
some kind of  text-streaming system working, tonight.  For  it is from
reading that lots of good will come.

Textual redundancy metrics.
